# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

For the ETL mini project, we worked with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transform the data, we created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

A Category DataFrame is Created 

A Subcategory DataFrame is Created 

A Campaign DataFrame is Created 

A Contacts DataFrame is Created

A database schema labeled, crowdfunding_db_schema.sql is created 
A crowdfunding_db is created using the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file 
The database has the appropriate primary and foreign keys and relationships 
 
The data from each table is displayed using a SELECT * statement
